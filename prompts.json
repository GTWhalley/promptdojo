    "scenario": "You want the AI to summarize a long article for you.",
    "option_a": "Summarize this.",
    "option_b": "Summarize the following article in 3 bullet points, focusing on the key findings and actionable insights.",
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "Option B is superior because it specifies the format (3 bullet points), the focus areas (key findings and actionable insights), and sets clear expectations for the output structure. Option A is too vague and could result in any length or format of summary."
  },
  {
    "scenario": "You need the AI to write a professional email declining a meeting invitation.",
    "option_a": "Write an email saying I can't come to the meeting.",
    "option_b": "Write a professional email politely declining a meeting invitation for Tuesday at 2pm. Express appreciation for being invited, briefly mention a scheduling conflict, and offer to receive meeting notes afterward. Keep the tone warm but professional.",
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "Option B provides specific context (Tuesday 2pm), defines the tone (warm but professional), includes required elements (appreciation, reason, alternative), and gives clear structure. Option A lacks detail and could produce an abrupt or inappropriate response."

    "scenario": "You want to generate a Python function that validates email addresses.",
    "option_a": "Write a Python function to check emails.",
    "option_b": "Write a Python function called `validate_email(email: str) -> bool` that checks if an email address is valid. Use regex pattern matching. Include docstring with examples. Handle edge cases like empty strings and missing @ symbols.",
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "Option B specifies the function signature, implementation approach (regex), documentation requirements (docstring with examples), and edge cases to handle. This level of detail ensures consistent, production-ready code rather than a minimal implementation."

    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "Option B establishes specific evaluation criteria (hook, clarity, flow), requests actionable feedback (specific suggestions), and focuses the review on particular aspects. 'Is this good?' is subjective and would yield vague, unhelpful feedback."
  },

    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "Option B describes expected vs actual behavior, specifies the error type, provides context (Python version), and requests both explanation and fix. This gives the AI the information needed to diagnose accurately rather than guess at the issue."
